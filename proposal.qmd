## High Level Goal

For Project 2, we want to explore the R package BrailleR.

## Research Question

How effective of a tool is BrailleR in terms of accessibility for creating alternative text of plots created in R for visually impaired users?\

## Description of Goals

BrailleR is fairly new R package (released in 2023) that creates alternative text (text descriptions) AKA "alt text" of visualizations that visually impared users can more easily access via screen-readers than pure visualizations. We want to demonstrate how to use it as well as analyze how effective of an accessibility tool it is based on the quality of the alt text. The reason that we chose this data set is because accessibility and inclusion are important and being able to see a plot is something that a lot of individuals take for granted.

In order to accomplish this, we will use a a series of cherry picked data sets that easily translates to different types of plot of varying complexity.The goal is to use various plots such as bar plots, pie charts, histograms, regression plot, time series, and heatmaps. For each plot, BrailleR will be used to create alt text for it. Effective alt text should contain short and long descriptions, translations of data into appropriate descriptions, and limit search engine optimization word choice. Because of its relatively recent release, we expect BrailleR to not be able to create accessible alt text for all visualizations and want to highlight its current limitations.
