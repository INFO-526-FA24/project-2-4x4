## High Level Goal

For Project 2, we want to explore the R package BrailleR.\

## Description of Goals

BrailleR is an R package that creates text descriptions of visualizations that visually impared users can more easily access via screen-readers than pure visualizations. We want to demonstrate how to use it and how it will be beneficial to users. The reason that we chose this data set is because accessibility and inclusion are important and being able to see a plot is something that a lot of individuals take for granted.

In order to accomplish this, the data that we choose isn't particularly important and we are demonstrating a tool rather than showing trends of given data. As a result, we are going to use different data sets that match the type of plot we want to create. In addition, these datasets may or may not be related since the content of the data is not as important as the ability for the data to be displayed with specific plot types. For these datasets, we are going to create three distinct plots each with different features and use BrailleR on the plot to show how it makes the visualization more accessible and what the text description looks like.

The first dataset is going to be used to create a time series plot. The second dataset is going to be used to create histogram and a regression plot. This will ensure that we have a variety of plots to showcase BrailleR capabilities.
